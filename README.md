Simulate the [HPAScaleToZero](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) feature gate, especially for managed Kubernetes clusters,
as they don't usually support non-stable feature gates.

`kube-hpa-scale-to-zero` scales down to `zero` workloads instrumented by HPA when the current value of the used _custom_ metric is `zero` and resuscitates them when needed.
