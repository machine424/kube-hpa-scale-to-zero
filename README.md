# kube-hpa-scale-to-zero

Simulate the [HPAScaleToZero](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) feature gate on managed Kubernetes clusters,
as they don't usually support non-stable feature gates.

`kube-hpa-scale-to-zero` scales down to `zero` workloads instrumented by HPA when the current
value of the used custom metric is `zero`.

Check the code and comments in [main.py](./main.py) for more details.

### Run

`python main.py --hpa-label-selector foo=bar,bar=foo --hpa-namespace foo`

or

`python main.py --help`

### Deploy

Docker images are published [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/machine424/kube-hpa-scale-to-zero).

A Helm chart is also available [here](). (Coming soon)
